            <p>We, Trustcare Old Age Home, situated at Malad West, Mumbai, Maharashtra help in providing a quality and
              respectful living for senior citizens with the help of qualified professionals, with a dream to nurture
              each other's growth in a spirit of commitment, trust and transparency. We create a friendly, caring and
              family-like atmosphere for the elderly people, where they can share their joys and sorrows and live
              happily.</p>
            <p>There are various stages in human, life, including infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old
              age. We all have to come and journey across these ages. However, our behaviour, attitude, temperaments and
              physical fitness are different in every stage. Also, not to forget that man is a social animal. He or she
              cannot stay in isolation. He needs to live in a family, with his friends in society. The entire world
              works smoothly on interdependence. Love, affection, and care are mutual, and they help a person live and
              not merely exist.</p>
