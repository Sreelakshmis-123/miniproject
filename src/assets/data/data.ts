    "description":"A retirement home – sometimes called an old people's home[1] or old age home, although old people's home can also refer to a nursing home[2] – is a multi-residence housing facility intended for the elderly. Typically, each person or couple in the home has an apartment-style room or suite of rooms. Additional facilities are provided within the building. This can include facilities for meals, gatherings, recreation activities, and some form of health or hospital care.[3] A place in a retirement home can be paid for on a rental basis, like an apartment, or can be bought in perpetuity on the same basis as a condominium.[4]A retirement home differs from a nursing home primarily in the level of medical care given. Retirement communities, unlike retirement homes, offer separate and autonomous homes for residents. Retirement homes offer meal-making and some personal care services.[5] Assisted living facilities, memory care facilities and nursing homes can all be referred to as retirement homes. The cost of living in a retirement home varies from $25,000 to $100,000 per year, although it can exceed this range, according to Senior Living Near Me's senior housing guide.In the United Kingdom, there were about 750,000 places across 25,000 retirement housing schemes in 2021 with a forecast that numbers would grow by nearly 10% over the next five years.[7]",

    "description":"Health check-ups are designed not only to detect medical issues, but also to identify risk factors and illnesses before they start to cause problems. Health check-ups aim to not only help the person to prevent illnesses and its complications but also to make changes in the lifestyle for long-term healthy life.According to studies, people who go for check-up occasionally attract diseases more than people who go for check-ups every year. It happens because more than 80% people don’t follow a healthy lifestyle and going for regular check-ups make us more aware about health, current lifestyle and also about what we should follow to live a healthy life.Always be careful with the healthcare provider you choose. People can sometimes be given a false diagnosis if they fall in hands of the quacks. This can lead to more medical issues. Hence it is very important to pick and go for an authentic health check-up through which one can get the right assessment of health.",

     "description":"An interactive conversation along with some loud laughter and sharing of thoughts is what makes the environment friendly in an apartment. Apart from just sharing the general views, an interactive session can also include the glitches and solutions of an apartment society. They not only help senior citizens but also help adults and children to provide clarifications. The apartment management can organise an interactive session on a monthly basis only with the members or even have panelists and participants chosen. Doing this polishes the interaction amongst the participants and the panelists. The panelists provide an introduction to the framework of the session and act as moderators, while the participants are encouraged to drive the session discussion.",
